# Problem
The Nautilus development team shared requirements with the DevOps team regarding new application development.â€”specifically, they want to set up a Git repository for that project. Create a Git repository on Storage server in Stratos DC as per details given below:


Install git package using yum on Storage server.

After that create a bare repository /opt/blog.git (make sure to use exact name).

# Solution
sudo yum install git

sudo mkdir /opt/blog.git

cd /opt/blog.git

sudo git init --bare
